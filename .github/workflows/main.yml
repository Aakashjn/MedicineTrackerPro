      - name: Install backend dependencies
        run: |
          cd backend
          npm install

      - name: Install frontend dependencies (if separate npm install needed)
        run: |
          cd frontend # Adjust if your frontend also has a package.json
          # npm install # Uncomment if your frontend uses npm for dependencies (unlikely for pure HTML/CSS/JS)

      # Placeholder for running tests (Jest)
      - name: Run backend tests
        run: |
          cd backend
          npm test

      # This is where you'll integrate the rest of your tools.
